First things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n1git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder. If unsure, learn how to update hugo modules\nIf you choose Option 2 or Option 3 below, ensure you edit these lines in the config.toml file as advised on the comments  Option 2 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\n1hugo new site yourSiteName 2cd yourSiteName 3git init 4git submodule add https://github.com/onweru/compose/ themes/compose 5cp -a themes/compose/exampleSite/* .

To do so, use the following commands:\n1git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server --themesDir ../..  Although, option 3 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes.

Or would you like to make it easier for someone (a non-techie, perhaps) in your team to make edits easily? If interested, follow along. Else, skip to the next section\nLet's sync your site with forestry CMS.\nPrerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, forestry will read from github and write (commmit) to your github repo.\nGitlab or bitbucket will work too. Just check their implementation here. Happy fishing.  Requirement 1 : A Forestry account Jump over to forestry and sign up for an account. Consider signing up using your github account. That way, you don't have to deal with passwords.\nRequirement 2: A Netlify account (optional) If you intend to host with something other than Netlify e.g github pages, please scroll on. Hosting with Netlify is a lot of fun though; I highly recommend it.\nStep 1 : Fork or Clone Compse theme First we will fork this bigspring template.\nStep 2 : Add your repository in Forestry The exampleSite already comes with prefilled default forestry settings. If you set up your site using option 2, look for a file .forestry/settings.yml and remove all exampleSite/ strings from it.

This sidebar will list links to all the pages in the documentation pages. Beneath each link, there will be a collapsible list of table of contents' links. These nested lists will unfold automatically on the active/current page.\nHome Page At the root level there's an _index.md page which is the homepage. Feel free to edit it as you like.\nOther pages You can also add as many regular pages as you like e.g about.md, contact.md...\nTake advantage of shortcodes to customize the layouts of these pages and any other.\nDoes this theme support blogging function? Currently, no.\n","link":"https://juneleung.github.io/docs/compose/organize-content/","title":"Content organization"},{"body":"Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.\nWhy shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it's insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.\nThis way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.\nSometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won't. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed. Please see the link I provided above and the markdown files for examples. You'll get the gist pretty quickly.\nI've setup the following shortcodes:\nBlock Takes positional modifiers\nExample\n1... 2 {{\u0026lt; block \u0026#34;modifiers\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 3 \u0026lt;!-- Nest columns or content --\u0026gt; 4 {{\u0026lt; /block \u0026gt;}} 5...

At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:\n1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter. They will be redirected to the search page which will contain matched results if any.\n2. Live search This behaviour will be obvious as the user types a search query on the search field. All valid search queries, will yield a list of quick links or a simple no matches found. Else, the user will be prompted to continue typing.\n Please note that the results under quick links will be a truncated list of the most relevant results. Only a maximum of 8 items will be returned. This number is pragmatic at best if not arbitrary. On the search page, the number is set to 12.\n Note that live search on the search page will behave differently than on the other pages. Nonetheles, the pages apply the same live search principle.\n Hitting enter while typing on the search page will be moot as that page’s content will live update as you type in the search word / phrase.\n Customize search feedback labels Use the i18n files to do so.\nWhat is a valid search query A valid search query must be long enough. If the search query can be cast as a float, then it only need contain one or more characters.\nElse the search query must be at least 2 characters long.\n","link":"https://juneleung.github.io/docs/compose/search/","title":"Search Function"},{"body":"Using chart js library you can display data you have stored in a csv file as a pie chart, bar graph or doughnut chart.\nAt this point if you want to display data from a json or yaml file, you would need to convert it into csv first.

You may extend the multilingual functionality by following the official documentation.\nThings to consider in multilingual:\n supported languages are configured in config/_default/languages.toml add new language support by creating a new file inside i18n directory. Check for missing translations using hugo server --i18n-warnings taxonomy names (tags, categories, etc...) are translated in i18n as well (translate the key) menus are translated manually in the config files config/_default/menus/menu.xx.toml menu's languages list are semi-hardcoded. You may chose another text for the menu entry with languageMenuName. Please, do better and create a PR for that. content must be translated individually. Read the official documentation for information on how to do it.  note: if you do NOT want any translations (thus removing the translations menu entry), then you must not have any translations. In the exampleSite that's as easy as removing the extra translations from the config/_default/... or executing this onliner:\nsed '/^\\[pt]$/,$d' -i config/_default/languages.toml \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm config/_default/menus/menu.pt.toml Comments Clarity supports Hugo built-in Disqus partial, you can enable Disqus simply by setting disqusShortname in your configuration file.\n disqusShortname should be placed in root level of configuration.\n  You can also create a file named layouts/partials/comments.html for customizing the comments, checkout Comments Alternatives for details.\n","link":"https://juneleung.github.io/docs/clarity/customize/","title":"Customization"},{"body":"Images Image figure captions You have the option of adding captions to images in blog posts and automatically prepending a desired string such as \u0026quot;Figure N\u0026quot; to the alt text.

They will be specified using a frontmatter variable as follows:\n1...2thumbnail:\u0026#34;images/2020-04/capv-overview/thumbnail.jpg\u0026#34;3...The thumbnail image will take precedence on opengraph share tags if the shareImage parameter is not specified.\nArticle featured image Each article can specify an image that appears at the top of the content. When sharing the blog article on social media, if a thumnail is not specified, the featured image will be used as a fallback on opengraph share tags.\n1...2featureImage:\u0026#34;images/2020-04/capv-overview/featured.jpg\u0026#34;3...Share Image Sometimes, you want to explicitly set the image that will be used in the preview when you share an article on social media. You can do so in the front matter.\n1...2shareImage = \u0026#34;images/theImageToBeUsedOnShare.png\u0026#34;3...Note that if a share image is not specified, the order of precedence that will be used to determine which image applies is thumbnail =\u0026gt; featureImage =\u0026gt; fallbackOgImage.

This is to ensure a large number of tags or categories can be easily managed without consuming excess screen real estate. Edit the numberOfTagsShown parameter and set accordingly.\n1[params]2...3numberOfTagsShown = 14# Applies for all other default \u0026amp; custom taxonomies. e.g categories, brands see https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies#what-is-a-taxonomy4...Number of tags example Table of contents Each article can optionally have a table of contents (TOC) generated for it based on top-level links.

Code which has the number of lines exceed this value will dynamically cause two code block expansion buttons to appear, allowing the user to expand to full length and contract. This is useful when sharing code or scripts with tens or hundreds of lines where you wish to control how many are displayed. Under params in config.toml file, add a value as follows:\n1[params]2...3codeMaxLines = 10# Maximum number of lines to be shown by default across all articles.4...

That is to say, one CSS file and one JavaScript file. Using Hugo minify functions, these files will be minified to optimize the size.\nGoing by the above 👆🏻 reason, we recommend adding custom CSS and JS via this custom SASS file and custom JavaScript file.\nHowever, sometimes you may need to load additional style or script files. In such cases, you can add custom .css and .js files by listing them in the config.toml file (see the snippet below).
